# My Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio site.  The website showcases information about me, including my background, skills, projects and contact details, in a clean and responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive design:** Built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.  Works on desktop, tablet and mobile screens.
- **Sections:** Includes About Me, Skills, Projects, Experience/Education and Contact sections.
- **Smooth scrolling and animations:** JavaScript adds interactivity and smooth transitions between sections.
- **GitHub Pages deployment:** Can be hosted for free on GitHub Pages; simply enable the Pages feature in your repository settings.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page containing all sections.
- `style.css` – stylesheet defining layout, colours and typography.
- `script.js` – adds smooth scrolling and any dynamic behaviour.
- `deepalisachan.jpg` – avatar image used on the site.

## Getting started

1. **Preview online:** Once deployed on GitHub Pages (or another hosting service), you can view the live site at:

   ``
   https://deepalisachan04.github.io/my-portfolio/
   ``

   *(Replace with your custom domain if using one.)*

2. **Run locally:** Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepalisachan04/my-portfolio.git
   cd my-portfolio
   # Double‑click index.html or run a local server
   python -m http.server
   ```

   Then visit `http://localhost:8000` to view the site.

## Customisation

This project is a template.  Feel free to replace the text and images with your own content, update styles in `style.css` to match your brand, and extend `script.js` to add more interactivity.  You can also integrate frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind if desired.
